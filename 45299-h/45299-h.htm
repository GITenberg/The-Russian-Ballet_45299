    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Russian ballet,
      at least that section of it which M. de Diaghiliev, patron and grand
      seigneur rather than agent, has taken all over Europe during the last few
      years, and more recently to America, is now more than a darling of its own
      nation, a naturally ballet-loving nation. It has become an international
      possession. In England the Russian dancers have perhaps been acclaimed
      with more whole-hearted fervor than elsewhere, because before their coming
      the land was barren. In France and Italy they had ballets of their own.
      They have a standard by which they can measure the visitors from St.
      Petersburg. But English audiences, like children presented with a new toy,
      first shyly wondered at the novelty of the agile strangers, and then fell
      into transports of enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uncritical enthusiasm toward art and artists is an amiable attitude of the
      English once they have been gained over. And this enthusiasm has a way of
      persisting. "The English public may be slow," said a musician who had
      taken a long time to win their suffrages, "but they are damnably
      faithful!" If the fashion in Russian ballet should age elsewhere I feel
      sure it will not in England, the last country to adopt it. So these notes
      by an enthusiast have a good chance of being seasonable for many years.
      Yes, I claim to be an enthusiast, although, perhaps, the fact that I am
      not an English enthusiast but one who is half Irish and half Scotch makes
      me more canny than some of my fellow-admirers. I have never opened my
      mouth and swallowed the new ballet and all its works without thinking.
      These are, all the same, impressions rather than criticisms. And the
      impressions are not intended as an explanation of Miss Pamela Colman
      Smith's pictures any more than her pictures are intended to be an
      explanation of my impressions. Her pictures surely speak for themselves.
      And like the clerk, I need only cry "Amen" to her eloquent drawings.

      Dancing In General
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HAT is dancing?
      The Russians have done much to show us that it is something more than <i>sauterie</i>,
      although they can <i>sauter</i>, or leap, with the best. As an actress I
      salute dancers with the reverence of a man for his ancestors. The dancer
      is certainly the parent of my own art, but he has other children. All
      arts, of which the special attribute is movement, descend from the dancer.
      The Greek word "chorus" means dance, and the Greek choruses were
      originally dances. It can be proved that dancing movements formed the
      first metres of true poetry. Why do we speak of "feet" if not because the
      feet of the body used to mark the rhythm of inspired utterance?

      Religious Dancing
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T seems strange
      that the Dance should have almost everywhere degenerated into something
      base and trivial, while its children, Music and Poetry, in spite of
      lapses, should have preserved their dignity and beauty. It seems even more
      strange when we remember that dancing had a religious origin. Among the
      Jews, as among other peoples, dancing was constantly associated with the
      ceremonies of faith.

      In Christian churches the choir was originally designed as a place in
      which the chanting of hymns and canticles might be conveniently
      accompanied by rhythmic movements. On feast days the honor of leading the
      dance was reserved for the bishop. This is why he was known in those days
      by the name, of <i>praesul</i>, the is, he who dances first. A bishop as
      <i>premier danseur!</i> We can hardly believe it now, yet why should we
      not, seeing that the movements of priest and server at mass have the
      nature of a solemn dance? And there are places in France and Spain where
      liturgical dances still exist. The most notable is the dance executed
      before the altar at Seville in Holy Week. I am afraid that the one that
      used to take place in the choir of Saint Leonard's at Limoges, where, at
      the end of each psalm, the people sang instead of the <i>Gloria Patri</i>,
      "San Marceau, pray for us and we will dance for you," is now extinct.

      The Russian Revival
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>LL who regard
      dancing seriously, and there is nothing which should be regarded more
      seriously than an art that is to give pleasure, must be glad that they
      have lived in a century which has witnessed a very fine and sincere
      endeavor to restore the dance to some of its primal nobility. There is
      much in the results of this endeavor to criticize, there are a few things
      to deplore, but in any refusal to recognize the magnitude of what has been
      accomplished, there is probably some pique that it has been the nation
      which Europe still views as barbarously ingenuous in matters of art which
      has reformed the ballet on such refined and spiritual lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      I dislike the word "reformed," however. Reformations are generally
      tiresome. <i>Transformations</i> are far better! Saint Francis
      transformed, Luther reformed; and the Russians are with Saint Francis
      rather than with Luther! To appreciate the change which has come over the
      Russian Ballet we ought to know a little about its constitution. It is and
      has always been subsidized by the state. The Russian government supports
      schools of ballet, where from the age of eight children are given a long
      and arduous training in the science of dancing, and from which they are
      drafted into the imperial ballets at St. Petersburg, Moscow and Warsaw. A
      dancer's first appearance is generally made at the age of sixteen, and at
      thirty-six his or her career is over. The dancers are then retired on a
      pension amounting to about one hundred and fifty pounds a year. It is not
      my intention to give details of this training. They are written in many
      books by experts. But I should like to say at this point that one of the
      leading characteristics of the Russian system is the attention given to
      male dancing.

      dancers ever been excluded from the Imperial ballet its fate would have
      been very different. The men are trained on the "ballon" system, not on
      that which is known as the "parterre," and it is "ballon" dancing which is
      one of the most beautiful features of the Russian ballet. After we have
      watched interminable exercises ingeniously performed "sur les pointes,"
      with what relief have we seen Nijinsky, perhaps the greatest "ballon"
      dancer who has ever existed, bound on to the stage, rise high in the air,
      descend slowly and with such art that when he touches the ground he can
      use it again for a still higher flight.

      It does away with the necessity for those feminine travesties of men,
      known in our pantomimes as "principal boys," who introduce an element into
      ballet which at its best makes a disturbing demand on our capacity for
      illusion, and at its worst is a little degrading. What has made the Male
      Dancers word "ballet" a sort of synonym for vice if it is not the idea
      that it provides an opportunity for women to attract admirers&mdash;not so
      much on account of their dancing as for the sake of their physical charm?
      I think that a mixed ballet has the effect of concentrating attention on
      the art of the dance rather than on the seductiveness of the dancers. And
      the free and noble plastic of the male dancers in the Russian ballet has
      influenced the plastic of the women, making it far less sexual and far
      more beautiful.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> FRANKLY confess
      that I have a dislike to ordinary dancing on the toes. It may be because
      in my youth it had degenerated into something so stilted, distorted and
      unrhythmical that it conflicted with all my ideas of beauty. And when the
      Russians give some of their older ballets, such as "Giselle," which bears
      the mark of Italian influence&mdash;it was, I think, arranged by an
      Italian <i>maître de ballet</i> &mdash;I feel that all the improvements
      that the Russians have made in this so-called "classical" dancing cannot
      uproot my prejudice, although they can, and do, modify it. The Russian
      ballerinas accomplish the feat of being <i>fluent</i> on their toes. They
      do not hammer out steps&mdash;it is a false notion of rhythm that there is
      a hammer-stroke on every strong beat&mdash;but take a collection of steps,
      as a singer takes a collection of notes, and calmly and gracefully phrase
      them, in the manner of a bird beating the air with its wings, rather than
      that of a blacksmith hammering on his anvil. Still I doubt whether the
      Russians would have conquered Europe had they come to us merely as
      revivers of classical dancing before it became mechanical and ugly. They
      owe this revival to a great extent to Tschaikowsky.

      Italian dancers and Italian methods. Undoubtedly he gave good counsel in
      advising a return to the French style of classical dancing, the style
      which was at its best under Louis XIV. But if the Russians had been
      content to stop at an imitation of ballet as it was under the "Grand
      Monarque" they would still be giving us only a dead perfection of steps.
      There is a deadness about all Renaissance things, whether in architecture
      or dancing. What always surprises us about the Russian ballet is its <i>life</i>.
      This vitality came sweeping on to the stage with Russian <i>maîtres de
      ballet</i> such as Fokine, who used tradition, used the technical
      perfection of classical dancing, but would not be a slave to them; with
      Russian composers such as Borodin, Rimsky-Korsakoff, Glazounof, Liadoff,
      Arensky, Stravinsky and Tscherepnin, the conductor of the ballet; with
      Russian artists such as Alexandre Benois and Leon Bakst; with Russian
      dancers such as Nijinsky. Is this ballet, then, distinguished from all
      other ballets by being a <i>native</i> ballet? When we see "Tamar" or
      "Scheherazade" or the dances from "Prince Igor" we may answer, "Yes." But
      what about "Les Sylphides," "Spectre de la Rose' ' or "Le Carnaval"? Are
      <i>they</i> typically Russian? I think they rather transport us into a
      country which has no nationality and no barriers, the kingdom of dreams.
      The Russian ballet has transformed itself in a little over a decade
      because its guiding minds have been more than national. The musicians,
      artists, dancers and ballet masters have depended more on invention than
      on reality. Many stories of widely different character have been drawn on
      for the new ballets, but all have been treated with an imagination which
      is neither the property of a nation nor the result of patriotism.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Russians pride
      themselves on not having a "star system." Every dancer has a chance of
      distinction. A good idea, but personality will out, and genius cannot be
      effaced. "I am only the centre-piece of a great mosaic," said Nijinsky
      once, but in his case it is a very big "only." Certainly the perfection of
      the <i>ensemble</i>, the well-ordered movements and groups of Fokine,
      assist this wonderful young god of the dance.

      When Anna Pavlova, whom I still regard as the best of the women Russian
      dancers, was torn from her original setting, many admirers of her
      exquisite art, in which all the essentials of the dance, noble gesture,
      beautiful line, lightness, elevation, that order of movement which we call
      rhythm, and perfect time, are to be found, congratulated themselves, "Now
      we shall get more of her." We got more&mdash;and less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nijinsky, in the years when Pavlova was still in the ballet, was allowed
      to have talent. Lately we have all begun to use the word "genius." Where
      does the difference between the things talent and genius lie if not in the
      huge personality of the genius?
    </p>
    <p>
      They used to say of Henry Irving, who expressed himself in a multiplicity
      of parts, that he was always the same Irving. Certainly he was always
      faithful to himself whatever he assumed. This is a sign of the presence of
      genius, not of its absence. In one sense we always have the same Nijinsky,
      as Miss Pamela Colman Smith has very happily shown in her drawings of him.
      Yet in another sense we never have the same Nijinsky.

    <h2>
      Nijinsky's Distinction
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>E must not
      belittle him by merely admiring him for his miraculously agile leaps and
      jumps. As I said at the start, dancing is not only <i>sauterie</i>. There
      was probably no <i>sauterie</i> at all in the dancing of the ancients. I
      am told that Nijinsky was much affected by the dancing of Isadora Duncan
      when, some years ago, she appeared in St. Petersburg, and I can well
      believe it, for there was manifested in her at her best what was probably
      the supreme object of religious dancing&mdash;-and all ancient dancing was
      religious&mdash;the training of the body to the point of making it docile
      to the rhythm of the soul. There are many young men in the Russian ballet
      who dance excellently with their bodies, even if they cannot leap as high
      as Nijinsky, but what really separates him from them is the fact that he
      dances not only with his body, but with his soul. Unfortunately this
      expression is often used lightly to mean merely "with enthusiasm." But it
      can be used in a graver sense, and it is in that sense that I use it.

    <h2>
      Nijinsky Always a Dancer
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>O free and yet so
      disciplined!" said someone of Nijinsky's dancing. It was a very good
      criticism. But I like even better these words from a French appreciation
      by M. Charles Mèryel: "We should not begin by praising him for his
      prodigious physical ability for leaving the ground. Let us think first of
      his power of evoking, through the means of a human body in movement, a
      sort of beautiful dream, of his power of subjugating his material
      appearance so that he becomes a visitation divijie and almost immaterial."
      I remember in this connection something that was said to me by Christopher
      St. John after "Les Sylphides": "This gives us a conception of what our
      glorified bodies after the Resurrection will be like, the same bodies, but
      spiritualized and agile!" I thought, "This is too much!" and laughed at an
      excess of enthusiasm! But the French writer and the English one were both
      expressing the same idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever his role, the young Russian dancer projects an interior emotion
      which has in it all the force of spontaneity, but is at the same time
      conscious and considered. As an actress, that has always been my ideal of
      expression. But actors express emotions; it is generally their duty to <i>realise</i>,
      in fact, to recall a man. Nijinsky never recalls human experience, never
      suggests the passions of mankind. He is always the dancer. Now the miming
      of ordinary ballet-dancers has often in the past seemed to be more than a
      little ridiculous. Love and joy and pleasure, pain and hate and death&mdash;how
      could they be simulated by pirouettings, posings and posturings? Did I
      reject them as absurdly unconvincing because I did not understand the
      language of choreography? I think I was alienated because I had never
      heard the language spoken well. I am sure now that it can be infinitely
      expressive, but the better it is spoken by the dancer's body the less it
      will resemble the expression of mortals. I could never call Nijinsky a
      good actor. I can, and do, call him a great dancer.

      The Dance Poems
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T has been said
      that the Russian ballet makes a vivid and brutal appeal to the senses, and
      certainly there is some truth in this as regards the ballets of which the
      artist Bakst is the guiding spirit. The old saying that you cannot see the
      wood for the trees may be borrowed to express a criticism. You cannot see
      color for the colors in some Bakst ballets. Yet even Bakst sometimes helps
      to aid that impression of a visitation divine which Nijinsky in his own
      person produces. You will see that Miss Pamela Colman Smith has given what
      some may think a disproportionate amount of space to her studies of "Les
      Sylphides," "Le Carnaval," and "Le Spectre de la Rose." I think she was,
      perhaps unconsciously, more strongly attracted by these three dance poems
      (for dance poems they should be called rather than ballets) because of
      their greater wealth in the immaterial.

      Les Sylphides
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OME of the Russian
      ballets take a material story and treat it in terms of the dance. But what
      story is there in "Les Sylphides"? Even the programme, seldom at a loss
      for a synopsis, has never tried to tell us what it is all about. We hear
      preludes and waltzes, nocturnes and mazurkas by Chopin, and hear them
      orchestrated audaciously, but for the most part successfully, by
      distinguished Russian composers. We remember that when we heard these
      lovely Chopin pieces on the piano, interpreted by a Paderewski or a
      Pachmann, we had our mental dreams; we saw things, but not with our eyes.
      When the curtain rose on "Les Sylphides" we were asked to make our
      imagination abdicate its rights, to put away the films of that little
      individual cinematograph which we had made with closed eyes. The demand
      may have seemed impertinent to those who love the interior visions given
      by musical sounds better than the most beautiful spectacle that the
      theatre has ever presented. But "Les Sylphides" had not progressed far
      before we ceased to Les Sylphides be worried by the antagonism between
      dreams and stage pictures. The grace of those immaterial white figures,
      Victorian just so far as Chopin is Victorian, became one with the grace of
      the music.

      Perhaps the rhythm of the music has never been better perceived than
      through these well-ordered movements designed by Fokine. The appearance of
      Nijinsky as a kind of dream Alfred de Musset in a romantic fair wig, and
      dressed in black and white, among the impalpable Sylphides was both
      inexplicable and inevitable. When he danced he seemed almost to play
      Chopin with his feet, so perfect was his time. His steps seemed to be the
      symmetry of the music&mdash;in fact its rhythm, for the rhythm of music is
      symmetry in motion. And when he merely walked about with outstretched arm,
      he recalled Ruskin's allusion to man "in erect and thoughtful motion," to
      "the great human noblesse of walking on feet."

      as Pierrot, the unhappy dupe of Nijinsky-Arlecchino's teasing pranks.
      Bakst's scene, with its plain blue curtains and two absurd uncomfortable

      Until I saw "Le Carnaval," although I had realized that the art of the
      Russians was not narrow or local, and that they could dance in several
      languages, I fear I had not credited them with humor. The true comic
      spirit (which makes us smile, not laugh in the manner so offensive to Mr.
      Bernard Shaw) rules this delicious episode, which is a setting of
      Schumann's music in the way that music can be a setting of words,
      completing their message and intensifying their significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time I will use the word "acting" in connection with the
      Russian ballet. The comedy in "Le Carnaval" is of a very high order. The
      story is interpreted more through genuine pantomime than through dancing,
      which perhaps accounts for the popularity of this particular ballet with
      us English, who still understand the nature of good acting better than the
      nature of good dancing, although we are at the present time much attracted
      by dancing. A real note of freakish farce is in this "Carnaval." The
      dancing itself is freakish. It is the simplest, silliest thing! A bit of
      fun&mdash;yet to give us this bit of fun what serious work was needed! The
      grave young Nijinsky is transformed into a mischievous child!

      sound, marked rhythm help to create that sense of the <i>impossible</i>
      which is the abiding impression of the phantom of the rose.

      How this music pulsates! Its deep expectant breathing increases one's
      sensation that we are all dreaming&mdash;dancers and audience too. Tamar
      Karsavina, who in other roles shows a nervous force, a tragic power, a
      strange and luring grace which account even better than her dancing for
      her triumphant prominence, is so gentle, so modest, so suppliant in the
      "Spectre de la Rose," that she becomes the incarnation of snow-white
      youth, dreaming of a heavenly lover. And Nijinsky becomes the spirit of
      that dream. I feel sorry for that young girl, who perhaps will wake next
      day in that queer Bakst bedroom, and think of the partner who gave her the
      rose, not of the Rose itself, who came to her as virginal as the thought
      which summoned him. I don't like the idea of the remembrance of an
      ordinary flirtation at a ball walking in at the door of that room, out of
      whose window the mystical figure of the Rose flew forth into the night,
      which was, I am sure, day to him!

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE Russian dancers
      may reasonably pride themselves on their versatility. In their
      seven-leagued ballet shoes they travel all over the world, and beyond.
      They bound easily from ancient Greece to a Caucasian camp, from the East
      of a thousand-and-one nights to a legendary country invented for their
      playground. It really requires astonishing mental activity to follow them
      with pleasure from "Le Spectre de la Rose" to "Scheherazade." A symphonic
      poem of Richard Strauss after a plain-song hymn, or Wagner after Mozart,
      could not be a greater shock to brutal Scheherazade the system. Everything
      in "Scheherazade" suggests violence and horror.

      Bakst's palace was built for dreadful deeds; no one, I am sure, could ever
      feel safe in it. Its color makes it vibrate on its foundations, if indeed
      it has any foundations. There are bad dreams as well as good ones, and the
      dream quality, on which I have insisted, so far, as the special beauty of
      these Russian ballets and mimed poems, is present in "Scheherazade." The
      strange thing is that this nightmare, in which sensuality and cruelty are
      the only emotions evoked, has a paradoxical vein of delicacy running
      through it. There is something almost childlike in the wiles by which the
      Sultan's wives, when their lord's back is turned, induce the Master Eunuch
      to liberate the slaves for their pleasure. The infantile joyousness with
      which the dark-skinned youths rush from their silver and gold cages on
      their loves and on their impending doom has an element of pity. The
      whirligig dance which follows expresses exactly the happiness, which is
      short, sharp and sudden, but over which destiny hangs, and for which there
      is no mercy. And all the time in this riot of color, this orgy of
      animation, we never lose sight of the negro who is the chosen of the
      Sultan's favorite, the negro who half an hour ago in another world was the
      phantom Rose! His arms, which but now were waving invisible garlands in
      the serene air, are ready to coil round their prey in a serpentine
      embrace.

      The lips which gave the innocent kiss of naïve youth are now twisted in

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>AMAR" is another
      pleasant little ballet of barbarity, in which Karsavina, as one of those
      avid, fatal heroines, in the interpretation of whose serpentine passions
      she is always fine, lures lovers to her high tower, and, in the manner of
      the Chinese Empress, makes death the penalty of an hour of her love. The
      execution is summary, the unfortunate lover being hurled out of the window
      by muscular members of Tamar's suite. In "Tamar" Adolph Bolm, who was I
      think the first Russian male dancer to appear in England, makes a
      magnificent entrance. Miss Pamela Colman Smith's drawing gives a very
      vivid impression of the effect produced by the first appearance on the
      scene of the Lover and his companions. Here is a very good example of the
      amazing influence that the color and shape of mere garments can have on
      the imagination. Those silent, black-coated, black-hatted men, their faces
      muffled in concealing scarfs, seem to have come from far, from very far. I
      feel that their horses below are in a sweat, that they have been riding
      furiously at the summons of a force which their fresh and ardent youth
      could not resist!

      barbarity of decadence), and splendid music to take away all words, all

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N this ballet, in
      the style of the French ballets of the reign of Louis XIV., there is less
      distinction, I think, than in the others from which Miss Pamela Colman
      Smith has derived her pictures. The costumes and scenery are "designed by
      Benois," but any one with a knowledge of the theatre and a Racinet at hand
      could have done the same sort of thing. And yet as I write this I know I
      should make the reservation of that "life" which the Russians know how to
      breathe into everything. What I mean is that Benois gives us no new
      creation. Karsavina's bird-like grace in her eighteenth-century guise is
      captivating (oh, that this talented little dancer had more music in her,
      and did not dance always a fraction off the beat!), and Nijinsky as a
      wholly unnecessary slave in white satin gives a wonderful exhibition of
      dancing in the style of the original Ballon who danced at the opera in
      Paris at the end of the seventeenth century, and gave his name to the kind
      of classical dancing which consists in elevation.

     liked it better when it was originally given at the Coliseum
     as an extract, and danced by Kosloff, Karsavina and Baldina.
     Our spirited, bounding Nijinska has not got the eighteenth-

      this book is of Nijinsky as Narcisse, and if Narcisse had been a <i>pas
      seul</i> by Nijinsky I am sure that there would have been more to praise
      in it. For once, the mosaic was all wrong, and so the centre piece could
      not be all right. I have read enthusiastic accounts of "L'Apres-midi d'un
      Faune," which Nijinsky himself arranged, making Debussy's music the
      vehicle for a display of Greek poses, and from Nijinsky's personal
      performance in "Narcisse" I believe it to be possible that he has
      succeeded in doing, in "L'Après-midi de un Faune," what Bakst failed to do
      in "Narcisse. ' ' When, at the end of the ballet, that colossal stage
      narcissus was jerked up from the stage pool, and the limelight was turned
      on it, I regretfully saw in that light a limitation in the Russian art.
      They could not interpret the tranquil repose, the immanent beauty of Greek

      The whole treatment of the exquisite story of the youth who fell in love
      with his own beauty, and was drowned seeking to come near its reflection,
      was heavy-handed, even a little barbarous and ugly. And all the grave
      movements imprisoned in stone and marble by the sculptors of ancient
      Greece, all the joyous silhouettes on Greek vases, seemed to remain
      remote, and secure from the conquest of the devouring Russian, restlessly
      seeking material for his ballets in all nations and all times. I had a
      sudden seizure of distrust; it was as though the disdain of the Greek had
      sapped the foundations of my belief in the justness of the praises
      lavished on the new dance; but then memories of gestures, colors, bounding
      movements, freedom of expression given by perfection of technique, came
      crowding pell-mell into my mind. The frown on a cold marble forehead could
      not extinguish my joy in the flame of life which burns so ardently in the
      work of the Russian ballet.

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
